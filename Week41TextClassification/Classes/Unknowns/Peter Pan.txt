Once upon a time three children lived in London. Their names were Wendy, John and Michael Darling.

One night, Wendy woke up and there was a strange boy sitting on the floor. He looked cross.
“I’m Wendy,” she said, “who are you, why are you cross?”

“I'm Peter Pan,” the boy said, “I'm cross because my shadow won't stick to me.”

Wendy said, “oh, I can fix that.” She sewed Peter's shadow to the tips of his shoes. Peter was happy.

“Please fly back to Neverland with me and my fairy, Tinker Bell?” asked Peter, “you could be our mother and look after us”
“Will you teach me to fly?” Wendy asked. Peter nodded.

“I’ll wake John and Michael up” said Wendy, “if you teach us all to fly we can go to Neverland”

It wasn’t long before the children were flying around the bedroom.
